# alienfx-tools
A bunch of tools for Alienware LighFX controls:
- alienfx-cli - Make changes and check status of your AlienFX lights from the command line.
- AlienFX Universal haptics BETA - Visualize any sound around you (microphone, audio player, game, movie).
- AlienFX Ambient lights BETA - Visualize screen picture as ambient light (from desktop, game, video player).
- (In development) AlienFX Monitor - Visual feedback for CPU/RAM/HDD/SSD/Network loading.
<br>More will follow!

## Requirements
- Alienware LightFX DLLs installed on your computer. These are automatically installed with Alienware Command Center and 
should be picked up by this program.
- You should enable Alienfx API into AWCC: Settings-Misc at Metro version (new), right button context menu then "Allow 3rd-party applications" in older Desktop version 
- Windows 8+ (binary files for x64 only, but you can compile project for x86 as well).

Device checked: `Alienware m15R1`, `Alienware M13R2` (should work with any Alienware device with API 1.0 or later)

## Known issues
On some devices, some functions can work uncorrectly: can't retrieve positions and colors, can't set zone to action.
This may fixed in upcoming AWCC updates.<br>
<s><b>WARNING!</b> After latest AWCC update, they fix a bug with default lights, so now lights return back to default AS FAST AS APP LOST A FOCUS. It makes alienfx-cli useless, but i will fix it using batch mode and keep it working until stopped by user.</s> (fixed in 0.5.3)

## Installation
Unzip the installation archive to any directory of your choise, run.<br>
In case apps can't locate LightFX dll's, you can find it into /DLL folder and copy to apps folder one you need (for x32 or x64).</br>
<br>`alienfx-haptics` uses default output device (there are all sound from audio players, video players, games played) as an input, but you can switch it to default input device (f.e. microphone or line-in).

## alienfx-cli Usage
Run `alienfx-cli.exe` with a command and any options for that command. 
```
alienfx-cli.exe [command=option,option,option] ... [command=option,option,option] [loop]
```
The following commands are available:
- `status` Showing AlienFX devices and their lights IDs and status
- `set-all <r>,<g>,<b>[,br]` Sets all AlienFX lights to the specified color. Ex: `set-all=255,0,0` for red lights, `set-all=255,0,0,128` for dimmed red.
- `set-one dev-id,light-id,r,g,b[,br]` Set one light to color provided. Check light IDs using `status` command first. Ex: `set-dev=0,1,0,0,255` - set light #2 at the device #1 to blue color.
- `set-zone zone,r,g,b[,br]` Set zone light to color provided.
- `set-action action dev,light,r,g,b[,br,r,g,b[,br]]` Set light to color provided and enable action.
- `set-zone-action action,zone,r,g,b[,br,r,g,b[,br]]` Set zone light to color provided and enable action.
- `loop` Special command to continue all command query endlessly, until user interrupt it. It's provide possibility to keep colors even if awcc reset it. Should be last command in chain.
<br>Supported Zones: `left, right, top, bottom, front, rear`
<br>Supported Actions: `pulse, morph (you need 2 colors for morth), color (disable action)`

## alienfx-haptics Usage
Run `alienfx-haptics.exe`. At first launch, choose `Parameters-Settings` from top menu for setting up light mappings and colors.
<br>Minimize, then start player or game of choice.
```
How it works
```
This application get audio stream from default input device, then made a real-time spectrum analysis.
<br>After that, spectrum powers gropped into 20 groups using octave scale.
<br>For each light found into the system, you can define group(s) it should react, as well as color for Zero (low) and Max (High) power.
<br>It's also possible to compress diapasone if group always not so or so high powered - use low-cut as a bottom range and hi-cut as a top one (values are 0-255).<br>
Global parameter "Decay" defines how fast detected Peak Level decayed if not peak detected or increased if detected peak is higher (2xDecay). Keep it at default 10000 if you audio is 16-bit, alter to about 1000000 in case of 24-bit, set 0 to disable decay, or experiment with you own values.

## alienfx-ambient Usage
Run `alienfx-ambient.exe`. At first launch, set screen zones mapping to lights and parameters.
<br>Minimize, then start video player or game of choice.
```
How it works
```
This application get shot of screen (privary or secondary), then divide it to several zones.
<br>For each zone, dominant color calculated (you can see it at the button in app interface).
<br>For each light found into the system, you can define zone(s) it should follow. If more, then one zone selected for light, it will try to blend zone colors into one (NOT reccomeded to do it in 0.5.0, results can be ugly sometimes).
<br>You can also select which screen to grab - primary or secondary, if you have more, then one. 
<br>WARNING! Changing screen requires application restart to apply!
<br>"Divider" parameter defines how many pixels in the row will be skipped - working with full-screen image sometimes very slow. Increasing this value increase update performance, but decrease dominant color extraction presision. Default value is 8, ok for 4k screen with i7 CPU, you can increase it if update lights wit a delay, or decrease if works ok for you.
